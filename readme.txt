Allows administrators to modify a users author url from their profile page.

== Description ==

Ever want to change the url used to display your posts?  This plugin
allows a blog administrator to change a users url slug from their edit profile page.  

The plugin allows for the creation of new author slugs, but also saves old slugs a user has used in the past.

== Installation ==

1. Upload all the file in the zip file to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin work with multi site installations? =

Yes. The users author slug is changed across the entire network.

= What if the slug I entered in is already taken, what happens? =

The plugin will automatically check existing user author slugs, and if a slug is already 
being used it will append a dash with a number (ex. -2) until a slug is found that isn't being used.
